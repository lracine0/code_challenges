#You'll be in charge of implementing the API for drawing rectangles (and squares). The API must be able to:

#Render canvas
#Print the canvas and any shapes to standard output
#Add a shape to a canvas
#shape the shape to add. For now, assume you only have to deal with rectangles
#Clear all shapes from a canvas
#Create a rectangle
#start_x is the X coordinate of the upper-left-hand corner of the rectangle
#start_y is the Y coordinate of the upper-left-hand corner of the rectangle
#end_x is the X coordinate of the lower-right-hand corner of the rectangle
#end_y is the Y coordinate of the lower-right-hand corner of the rectangle
#fill_char is the character that should be used to draw the rectangle
#Change a rectangle's fill character
#char the character to use in order to draw a pre-existing rectangle
#Translate (move left, right, up, or down)
#axis which axis ('x' or 'y') should we translate the rectangle on? Translating on the X-axis will cause the rectangle to move left and right. 
#Translating on the Y-axis will cause the rectangle to move up and down.
#num is how much to move the rectangle. Negative numbers will cause the rectangle to shift left or down. 
#Positive numbers will cause the rectangle to #shift right or up.
#For now, assume that you're always working with a 10-by-10 character canvas (that's 10 characters wide and 10 characters tall). 
#Although it would be nice to implement an API for users to specify the dimensions 
#of their canvas, assume that another developer will be responsible for that.
